     * bbbâ€¦bbbbbba for this case, if we just update i to i + 1,time complexity will downgrade to o(n^2).
     * Let me try to prove why it safely move from i to i + k + 1. For example, for "cabcabx" the matching pattern is 'cab', at 'x' two candidates are mismatching. since 'x' > 'c', wen need move i, that's true we can just move to i + 1. However, as long as 'cab' is matching pattern. both 'a' and 'b' have been visited by j. so we can safely move to i + k + 1. In other words, now j becomes i, i becomes to j. why do you want to go back a visited index? the idea is a little similar with KMP.
